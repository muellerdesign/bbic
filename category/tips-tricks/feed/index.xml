<li>To determine the class of your device you need its regulation number.  The regulation number can be found through the FDA classification database or through the FDA device panel to which your device belongs.</li>

<li>A “top-down” analysis is based on current technologies or products that address the medical need your technology/product is intended to address, and the market defined by their sales figures.</li>
<li>The bottom-up analysis starts with identification and enumeration of the specific target patient population your technology/product will address.  What is the patient population and what are the trends projected over the development of your product and its lifetime on the market?</li>
<li>It is important in the pricing decision to consider who your customers and decision-makers will be. Each of these stakeholders may value your technology/product differently, so their roles and opinions will have to be factored into the pricing projection.</li>
<li>CoGS will be a key factor in development decision-making, with low-cost choices made to limit CoGS.  In the medical device field, the price typically needs to be four times CoGS to generate reasonable profit.</li>
<li>When you have an estimate of target patient numbers, price, and CoGS, you can do some simple math to get a revenue and profit forecast.</li>

<p><b>Who can apply for B-BIC grants?<br />
</b>Anyone holding a faculty appointment at a B-BIC member institution may apply for a B-BIC grant.</p>
<p><b>May I submit more than one application?</b></p>
<p>Applicants may submit more than one proposal to both the Pilot and DRIVE programs.  However, each application must have a distinct set of aims and work plan.</p>
<p><b>Is there a limit to the number of applications I can submit?</b></p>
<p>B-BIC encourages and supports the entrepreneurial personality.  Investigators are encouraged to re-apply with proposals for different applications of the same technology as well as new technologies.  Early determination of technology failure is part of the process.</p>
<p><b>Should I disclose any unprotected proprietary information in the submission? </b></p>
<p>Do not disclose any unprotected proprietary information.  Protecting proprietary information is the responsibility of the applicant and the applicant institution. Pharma and device companies are actively involved in the center providing expertise and supporting the development of commercial outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Who reviews the applications?<br />
</b>B-BIC reviewers include practicing clinical specialists and domain experts, engineers and scientists with broad experience in medical innovation, external business development and commercialization experts, and our Federal partners at the FDA, CMS, USPTO, and NIH.</p>
<p><b>Who retains the rights to any intellectual property generated by a proposal? </b></p>
<p>Management of intellectual property is determined by the policies of the institution responsible for the application.  Investigators funded by B-BIC are expected to establish IP with their institution’s technology transfer office, with an indication that B-BIC funding has been used to support their work.</p>
<p><b>Who do I call for help if I have questions about proposals or awards?</b></p>
<p>The B-BIC main office number is 857-307-2440.  Email may also be sent to Lesley Watts, B-BIC Director for Administration and Finance, at <a href="mailto:lwatts@partners.org">lwatts@partners.org</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The “build it and they will come” approach may have worked for Steven Jobs at Apple but does not work for most new products.  For us mere mortals, it is important to conduct customer research before proceeding too far with a new idea.  You want to know if there is a market for your product and what you might do to make the product better. The thought of contacting potential customers might be intimidating, but it is not as hard you might think with the right approach.</p>
<p>First, identify what you believe to be your potential customer target demographics.  Who are they?  Where are they located?  You may have a few customers to consider: the end user, a buyer (someone in a purchasing department), or a distributor. Then identity what you believe is important to each customer and develop a discussion outline. Different customer types will have different knowledge and interests. Once you have customers identified, take a look through your contacts and see if you have any mutual relationships to help make an introduction if needed. Then reach out to healthy sample within in each group</p>
<p>Remember, this is not a sales pitch.  Saying anything like “I have this fantastic new product that does XYZ, don’t you just love it” will quickly put the person on guard and may shut down the conversation.  This is an opportunity for you to learn what unmet needs your potential client might have, what obstacles might come about within the supply chain of your final product and any other information that might help you in the final stages of development.</p>
<p>People typically hate sales calls, but love to talk about their work, so when contacting someone for customer research make it clear that you are not trying to sell them anything, you are interested in learning more about their work and what challenges they face</p>
<p>If the need for your product does not surface when talking about challenges, gently steer the conversation in that direction.  Once the need is clear, ask if a product like yours might solve their problem. Listen more than talk and be open to new ideas.  Honestly assessing potential customer feedback will only help you refine your idea and avoid costly mistakes.</p>
<p>Toward the end of each conversation ask if there is anyone the person knows who you can contact for a similar conversation and if you can use the person’s name as a referral.  Interview as many potential customers as you can to get a diversity of inputs.  You will always learn something from talking to a potential customer no matter how many you have spoken with and you may find you really enjoy it and make some great contacts.</p>

<li>It is always important to know your competitors and how your product compares to theirs, but did you know competitors’ websites can also provide information on reimbursement and market size.  Companies often provide a reimbursement guide for their customers and a company’s annual report frequent has market size and market share data.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When searching for market information, put “pdf” or “ppt” after your key words.  This approach will focus the results on PDF files and PowerPoint presentations, which are frequently more relevant and detailed. Also you can use the “-word” function to eliminate those pesky non-relevant results that keep showing up.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Another great way to find market information is to do an image search rather than a general web search.  You will frequently find relevant graphs, bar charts, pie charts, and tables.  Follow the link of the image source to see if more information is available.</li>
