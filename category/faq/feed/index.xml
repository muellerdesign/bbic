<p><strong>Q:  Do I need to have slides? </strong></p>
<p>A:  Pitches only need to address the suggested elements.  Use of reference materials or other visual elements is welcome if they help convey the product concept and can be shared using your laptop screen.  AV equipment will not be available.</p>
<p><strong>Q:  How formal will the pitches be?</strong></p>
<p>A:  You will be pitching to 1-2 experienced biotech executives with everyone seated around a table.  There will be multiple tables in the room where other investigators will also be pitching.  Allow time for their questions and be prepared for them to ask several questions.</p>
<p><strong>Q:  Can I present confidential information?</strong></p>
<p>A:  Everyone hearing the pitches has signed confidentiality agreements.  However, since you will be pitching in an area where others may overhear or see your information we urge everyone to use their judgment when deciding what to share.</p>
<p><i>This event will provide you with the opportunity to pitch a team of experts on your research. You will receive immediate feedback with the opportunity to apply for our </i><a href="https://b-bic.org/funding/"><i>grant programs</i></a><i> which can provide up to $350,000 per project, business coaching, and project management.</i></p>

<p><b>Who can apply for B-BIC grants?<br />
</b>Anyone holding a faculty appointment at a B-BIC member institution may apply for a B-BIC grant.</p>
<p><b>May I submit more than one application?</b></p>
<p>Applicants may submit more than one proposal to both the Pilot and DRIVE programs.  However, each application must have a distinct set of aims and work plan.</p>
<p><b>Is there a limit to the number of applications I can submit?</b></p>
<p>B-BIC encourages and supports the entrepreneurial personality.  Investigators are encouraged to re-apply with proposals for different applications of the same technology as well as new technologies.  Early determination of technology failure is part of the process.</p>
<p><b>Should I disclose any unprotected proprietary information in the submission? </b></p>
<p>Do not disclose any unprotected proprietary information.  Protecting proprietary information is the responsibility of the applicant and the applicant institution. Pharma and device companies are actively involved in the center providing expertise and supporting the development of commercial outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Who reviews the applications?<br />
</b>B-BIC reviewers include practicing clinical specialists and domain experts, engineers and scientists with broad experience in medical innovation, external business development and commercialization experts, and our Federal partners at the FDA, CMS, USPTO, and NIH.</p>
<p><b>Who retains the rights to any intellectual property generated by a proposal? </b></p>
<p>Management of intellectual property is determined by the policies of the institution responsible for the application.  Investigators funded by B-BIC are expected to establish IP with their institution’s technology transfer office, with an indication that B-BIC funding has been used to support their work.</p>
<p><b>Who do I call for help if I have questions about proposals or awards?</b></p>
<p>The B-BIC main office number is 857-307-2440.  Email may also be sent to Lesley Watts, B-BIC Director for Administration and Finance, at <a href="mailto:lwatts@partners.org">lwatts@partners.org</a>.</p>
