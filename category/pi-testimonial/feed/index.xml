										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is how B-BIC has helped this project.</p>
<ol>
<li>The money itself. It would be very difficult to raise money for this project from standard sources.</li>
<li>Challenging questions from the reviewers. During the review of our preproposal, one challenge from the B-BIC point of contact was that we should design a Phase 3 trial for our product and see whether, with a reasonable number of patients, we could generate the statistical power needed to prove our product was superior to current EPO products. This is a very commercially focused question that an academic reviewer would never ask. It took us a long time to get the answer. However, it came in very handy in a recent investor pitch, in which an outside expert (who had run EPO clinical trials) asked me the same question and I was immediately able to answer it.</li>
<li>Back-and-forth with the reviewers, being able to respond to their comments. Doing this has also helped us understand the kind of questions that investors ask, and have ready answers. Also, clinician reviewers had a completely different take on our science than we did. We needed to significantly adapt our story to reach both of these audiences.</li>
<li>Evaluation based driven by the commercial opportunity</li>
</ol>
<p>To sum up, the challenging back-and-forth interaction with B-BIC people has been a huge plus. It has helped us prepare for investor meetings, and also helped us bridge the gap between our own reductionistic protein engineering worldview and that of clinicians.</p>

B-BIC has chosen targeted topics and emphasized commercial translation, making the program objectives clear. This aids the proposer in assessing likelihood of winning an award. The involvement of the program managers has been helpful and informative. The proposal evaluation and feedback prior to award was very thorough and I am grateful for the effort that went into that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The B-BIC program has been invaluable in two ways. First, the grant support has allowed us to bring our device from early prototyping stage to full preclinical testing and now at a point where we can focus on achieving FDA clearance for clinical use. Second, the support of advisors have taught me to navigate the various stages of device development from a practical business development perspective, which I now understand to be as critical as scientific proof-of-concept in transitioning any device from benchtop research towards bedside application.</p>
